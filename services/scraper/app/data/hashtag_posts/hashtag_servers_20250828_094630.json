Virtual Machines (VMs): Virtualized environments running multiple OSes on a single host. 3. Containers: Lightweight, portable units packaging apps with dependencies. 4. Serverless Computing: Cloud-based execution where the provider manages the servers. 5. Edge Servers: Servers closer to end-users for low-latency, responsive apps. Navigating this server spectrum is key to becoming a true DevOps master. 🚀 hashtag #devOps hashtag #servers hashtag #VirtualMachines hashtag #containers hashtag #serverless hashtag #nsd hashtag #cloud",
