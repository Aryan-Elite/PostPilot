I personally found a big difference when I started practicing with this FREE AI coding mentor tool 👉 https://lnkd.in/gAmKRSaA It doesn’t spoon-feed answers, but instead: ✔️ Pushes you to justify your Big O while coding ✔️ Challenges you to optimize suboptimal solutions ✔️ Throws curveballs like “What if input size doubles?” ✔️ Times your explanations so you get interview-ready If you’re aiming for companies like these, this might be the practice boost you need 🚀 hashtag #Hiring hashtag #JobAlert hashtag #SoftwareEngineering hashtag #DSA hashtag #CodingInterviews hashtag #CareerGrowth",

But interviews are about how you think, explain, and optimize. What helped me: ✅ Always start with brute force, then optimize. ✅ Before coding, list at least 5 edge cases. ✅ After solving, write time & space complexity. ✅ Dry-run on the worst-case input, not just samples. And here's a hack that helped me improve 10x, practicing under actual interview pressure with a timer using this FREE AI coding mentor tool https://lnkd.in/gAmKRSaA It doesn’t spoon-feed answers. Instead, it, → Forces you to justify your Big O while coding, not after → Asks \"Can you do better?\" when you submit suboptimal solutions → Throws complexity follow-ups: \"What if input size doubles?\" → Times your explanations so you get comfortable analyzing under pressure If you’ve ever felt that same fumble on “time complexity”, this might save you in your next interview. 💯 hashtag #DSA hashtag #CodingInterviews hashtag #DataStructuresAndAlgorithms hashtag #LeetCode hashtag #InterviewPreparation hashtag #ProblemSolving hashtag #DSA hashtag #CodingInterviews hashtag #AIForDevelopers hashtag #InterviewPreparation hashtag #CareerGrowth",

That’s when I came across TVARRA. A helmet brand started by a woman, for women. 🌸 Pastel colours 🌸 Floral prints 🌸 Lightweight fit and above all, 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘀𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆. And in that moment I realised, It wasn’t just a product. It was a statement. 💜 You matter. Your safety matters. Because for women who ride their own roads, safety shouldn’t come at the cost of self-expression. When you wear a TVARRA, you’re not just stepping outside. You’re stepping into your own story. 𝗕𝗼𝗹𝗱. 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀. 𝗙𝗿𝗲𝗲.

But here’s the thing nobody admits openly → getting a job isn’t just about solving questions. Yes, DSA matters. But it’s only one piece of the puzzle. To get noticed: → Work on at least 𝟮 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 you can explain (not just tutorial clones) → Strengthen your 𝗖𝗦 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹𝘀 (OOPs, DBMS, OS, Networking — they always come up) → Practice thinking out loud in interviews (𝗺𝗼𝗰𝗸 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀 help the most) If even one pillar is missing, shortlisting becomes 10x harder. And I get it… it feels like too much to handle alone. Because it is. But now you can easily prepare 1:1 with senior engineers who’ve sat on the other side of the interview table. 💯 The best part? You can connect with them for FREE here: https://lnkd.in/gsS_jzjR They bring decades of experience — guiding you with mock interviews, resumes, custom prep roadmaps, and insider tips. In fact, these senior SDEs have already helped 3000+ students crack offers at Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM and more. 💪 So if you’re feeling stuck, don’t blame yourself. Get the right direction. At the end of the day, preparation is your responsibility. But the right guidance?
