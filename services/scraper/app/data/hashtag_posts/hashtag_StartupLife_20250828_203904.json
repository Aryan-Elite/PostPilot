Perplexity's CEO, Aravind Srinivas, was frustrated navigating endless links just to buy health insurance. That small daily pain became a billion dollar idea , an AI that gives straight answers instead of more links.

      "text": "🚀 Remember your first solo ride in an auto-rickshaw as a kid? I do—vividly. I’d traveled in autos countless times with family, but that day, my father sent me alone from the city back home—20 km away. The whole journey, my mind raced: “Will I reach home safely? What if something goes wrong? What if the driver kidnaps me?” Every bump felt like a threat, every turn a potential disaster. Heart pounding, I gripped the seat, questioning if I’d make it. Looking back, that’s exactly how first-time founders feel when launching a startup. You’ve dreamed about it, planned it with mentors or “family” in the industry. But when you’re finally out there—solo—the fears hit hard: “Will this idea work? What if customers ghost me? What if I run out of runway and everything crashes?” The uncertainty is paralyzing, the “what-ifs” endless. It’s not just business; it’s personal survival in uncharted territory. But here’s the kicker: I made it home that day. And with each ride after, the fear faded into confidence. The same goes for entrepreneurship—those initial jitters build resilience. You learn to navigate the chaos, trust your instincts, and keep moving forward, one milestone at a time. If you’re a first-time founder staring down that road, know this: The fear is normal. It’s proof you’re pushing boundaries. What’s your “first auto ride” moment in business?

It has been 6 solid years of growth especially depth in OS internals (both Windows and Linux), being paid to contribute to open-source full time (!) (dream-come-true) and just all-round good time at Microsoft. One of the things I always told my colleagues especially the young bloods, use Microsoft even as Microsoft uses you. One thing that I can say for sure, I used Microsoft! And I leave with my head high, 0.00 regrets and proud of achievements I made -- both small and huge. Time will fail me to list them all.
