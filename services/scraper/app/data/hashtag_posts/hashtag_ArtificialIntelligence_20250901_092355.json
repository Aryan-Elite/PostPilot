      "text": "There‚Äôs something deeply human about what‚Äôs happening right now. This isn‚Äôt just about productivity, or cost, or speed, though all of those are very real drivers for us. Homo sapiens have always chased leverage. From stone tools to the printing press to the internet, we‚Äôve looked for ways to get more output from less effort. Artificial Intelligence is just a more advanced version of that equation. However, that same instinct has a flip side. Curiosity fuels discovery. Laziness fuels adoption. So are we curious or are we lazy? hashtag #HardSkills hashtag #ArtificialIntelligence hashtag #FutureOfWork hashtag #BuildWithAI",

Instead, I thought I‚Äôd show you. In this short video, I tested 3 things: - Changed the color of my shirt (green ‚Üí maroon) in 3 secs - Generated 3 different facial expressions of the same person. - And yes‚Ä¶ even had Elon Musk sitting right next to me. The results? A mix of fun, surprising, and a little mind-bending. Sometimes the best way to understand AI isn‚Äôt through words ‚Äî it‚Äôs through what you can actually see. üé• Watch the video ‚Äî and tell me: Which of these felt the most magical to you? And what other ‚Äúmagic‚Äù would you expect tools like this to do in the future? hashtag #GoogleAI hashtag #NanoBanana hashtag #AItools hashtag #FutureOfWork hashtag #Storytelling hashtag #AI hashtag #ArtificialIntelligence",

Artificial Intelligence holds immense promise, but nearly 95% of Gen AI pilots fail to deliver measurable business value, according to MIT‚Äôs recent report. The good news? These failures are not due to the technology itself but common pitfalls in execution‚Äîbusiness misalignment, poor data readiness, technical and organizational gaps that can be addressed with proactive measures. In my latest article, based on research, I unpack the root causes behind AI pilot failures that can be used as learnings and cautions to help business leaders align strategy, data, technology, and organizational readiness to succeed. I‚Äôve also created a fishbone diagram listing all possible root causes to help visualize these challenges clearly. üõ†Ô∏è Whether you're leading an AI initiative or evaluating pilot outcomes, this article offers actionable insights and early warning signs to get it right ‚Äî and avoid costly setbacks.

      "text": "Last night, while passing near the US Consulate by Gemini Flyover in Chennai, I took this picture with US President Donald Trump. üòÄ I can almost hear you saying, ‚ÄúIs this even real?‚Äù The photo was actually generated using Google‚Äôs Gemini AI editing feature called NanoBanana. Interestingly, when I first uploaded my photo, I asked it to place me with Sundar Pichai ‚Äî it declined. I then tried Elon Musk ‚Äî again, it said no. Then I asked for MS Dhoni ‚Äî still no. But when I requested Donald Trump, within seconds it gave me this edited photo! Later, I even tried Sachin Tendulkar and Ratan Tata, but it refused too. This raised a bigger question for me: Why would an AI system allow edits with some public figures but restrict others? As AI becomes part of our daily tools, questions of fairness, transparency, and responsible guardrails become even more critical. If an AI decides who we can or cannot appear with in a photo, what does that say about how biases are encoded and who gets to decide them? What do you think could be the reason? hashtag #Gemini hashtag #NanoBanana hashtag #PhotoEditing hashtag #AIPhotoEditing hashtag #ArtificialIntelligence hashtag #GenerativeAI hashtag #AIEthics hashtag #AIBias hashtag #ResponsibleAI",
