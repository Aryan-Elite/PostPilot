      "text": "These 20 tips will solve 95% interview problems. Save this post for revision 🔹 Problem-Solving Techniques 1. Two Pointers - When working from both ends — great for pairs, sorting, or partitions. 2. Sliding Window - Fixed or variable-size windows are perfect for max/min subarrays, longest substrings, etc. 3. Prefix Sum + Difference Array - Store running totals to convert range queries to O(1). - Use diff arrays when you need fast range updates. 4. Binary Search on Answer - When brute force is too slow — try BS on search space instead of array index. 5. Kadane’s Algorithm - For max subarray sum — also works with tweaks for circular arrays or product variants. 🔹 Implementation Optimizations 6. Overwrite Instead of Remove - Avoid shifting by replacing in-place (e.g., nums[i++] = nums[j]). 7. Avoid Re-sorting - Sort once only if needed — never inside loops. Use pointers or sets for O(n) logic. 8. Use Hashing - Map, Set, Boolean[] are powerful for frequency, uniqueness, or existence checks. 9. Count Arrays for Characters - Use int[26] or int[256] instead of Map<char, int> — faster in most languages. 10. Fast I/O - In contests, use faster I/O methods (BufferedReader, Scanner, etc.) to avoid TLE. 🔹 Debugging & Edge Cases 11. Preserve Input - If not told to modify input, make a copy. Prevents hard-to-trace bugs. 12. Off-by-One Errors - Most common mistake. Use dry runs or print indices to verify loop bounds. 13. Validate Edge Cases - Check for empty arrays, single elements, all negatives, or already sorted inputs. 14. Use Assertive Prints - Print indices, pointers, window start-end, and mid calculations while debugging. 15. Brute First → Optimize - Get a working brute force solution first, then find patterns to optimize. 🔹 Mindset & Prep Strategy 16. Don’t Memorize Code — Memorize Patterns 17. Editorials After Effort – Don’t give up in 10 mins. 18. Solve Variants – One pattern = 5+ problems. 19. Tag Your Mistakes – Pattern > practice. 20. Revisit After 7 Days – Retention > randomness. 🔹 Quick Hits (Save-worthy tips) - arr.slice() > mutating input - Use Math.max() inside Kadane's - Don’t use .sort() in every subarray question - Set.has() is O(1) — use it more - while (left < right) is safer than for (i = 0; i < n; i++) in many logic cases - charCode - 'a'.charCodeAt(0) → great for char-index mapping - Skip rechecking nums[i] === nums[i-1] if already handled - Read constraints — they often hint the optimal solution Need a roadmap for DSA?

Confusing quantity with mastery What you really need is depth, patterns, and the right roadmap. Here’s a list of resources (free & gold standard) and how to use them: ◉ Tech Interview Handbook – Not just theory, it’s a roadmap with coding templates, behavioral questions, and last-minute cheatsheets. Best for structuring your prep. => https://lnkd.in/gU6kk5eN ◉ Awesome Interview Questions (GitHub) – A handpicked list of questions across tech stacks. Use this to practice what companies actually ask. => https://lnkd.in/gY-AYpQk ◉ System Design Primer – Learn the fundamentals of designing scalable systems. Covers HLD + LLD with real-world examples. Must for mid/senior roles. => https://lnkd.in/g6yMEsGv ◉ Python Algorithm Implementations – Short, clear code snippets to revise common algorithms. Great for pattern recognition and last-minute brushing up. => https://lnkd.in/g7hv9ShZ ◉ Coding Interview University – A complete learning path from scratch to advanced topics. Perfect for structured self-study if you have 2–3 months. => https://lnkd.in/gWnd3n6C ◉ Front-End Interview Handbook – Tailored for JavaScript, React, and web dev roles. Includes theory, code challenges, and tricky browser-related questions. => https://lnkd.in/gpZpC_ZX ◉ JavaScript Algorithm Implementations – A quick reference for data structures and algorithms in JS. Helps in interviews where coding language matters. => https://lnkd.in/g9V7d-Ya These repos save time because they’re organized. They’ll teach you patterns, not just problems.

      "text": "I failed more than 20 coding interviews before I realized this: Solving hundreds of random Leetcode problems wasn’t the answer. What finally worked? Focusing on the core building blocks that almost every question is based on. Here’s what I wish I had learned earlier: 1. Arrays - Arrays are everywhere in coding interviews. - Master sorting, binary search, two-pointers, sliding window, and prefix sums. - Get so good at these that solving them feels as easy as writing a `for` loop. 2. Decision Trees & Recursion - If you understand recursive decision trees, you can solve: ✔️ Binary Trees ✔️ Backtracking Problems ✔️ Combinatorics ✔️ Dynamic Programming ✔️ Some Graph Problems - Many tough problems break down into decision trees, train yourself to see them. 3. Graphs - Graphs seem complex, but most problems rely on DFS & BFS. - Learn how to apply them to matrix graphs and adjacency lists, the implementation is different. - Understand the edge cases: infinite loops, cycle detection, shortest path problems. 4. Hashmaps - If your solution is too slow, ask: Can a hashmap make this faster? - Use it for: ✔️ Counting frequencies (strings, arrays) ✔️ Quick lookups (O(1) time) ✔️ Graph adjacency lists 5. Heaps - Use min-heaps and max-heaps when you need to find the top K elements efficiently. - Insertion & deletion: O(log N) - Heapify (building a heap at once): O(N) (more efficient than inserting one by one). 6. Dynamic Programming: - DP is hard, but it’s not as common in interviews as people think. - Focus on: ✔️ Longest Common Subsequence ✔️ Coin Change ✔️ Classic DP patterns (knapsack, LIS, partitioning) - Ignore ultra-complex DP problems—you likely won’t get them. Finally, Optimize for Efficiency, Not Exhaustion - You don’t need 1000+ problems. - Focus on understanding concepts deeply, not just solving for the sake of it. - Smart preparation beats brute force every time. The biggest lesson? Depth > Quantity. It’s not about 500+ solved problems; it’s about concept mastery. You need the right patterns, in the right order, with the right focus.

      "text": "Key DSA Patterns You Actually Need for Cracking Interviews at MAANG or FAANG or At Any Product Based Companies. 🔹 Arrays & Strings • Binary Search tricks (sorted arrays) • Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, DP (optimization) • Hashmaps/Sets (duplicates, frequency) • Subarray/Substring questions 🔹 Graphs • BFS, Dijkstra (shortest paths) • DFS, DSU (connectivity) • Topological Sort (dependencies) • Minimum Spanning Tree → Kruskal, Prim’s 🔹 Linked Lists • Floyd’s Cycle Detection • Reversals & Rotations • Middle node & Intersection 🔹 Trees (Binary & BST) • Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level-order • Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) • Balanced Tree checks • BST insert/search/delete 🔹 Dynamic Programming • Knapsack / Subset problems • Partitioning & Palindromes • LCS / Edit Distance • State-based DP: Paths, Games, Stocks 🔹 Stacks & Queues • Monotonic Stack/Queue (Next Greater Element, Sliding Window Max) • Min Stack, Valid Parentheses • Heaps / Priority Queues • Kth largest/smallest • Merging Intervals, Scheduling 🔹 Bit Manipulation • Subset generation • XOR tricks (unique/missing elements) This is what companies test — patterns, not 500+ random LeetCode problems. Once you can map a question to the right pattern, you’re already 50% done. You need the right patterns, in the right order, with the right focus. That’s what I’ve built for you: ✅ Notes that are concise and clear ✅ Most-asked questions per topic ✅ Real patterns + approaches to master them 👉 Grab the DSA Guide → https://lnkd.in/d8fbNtNv 𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐌𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐞𝐯 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐉𝐨𝐢𝐧 𝐌𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 : Telegram - https://lnkd.in/d_PjD86B Whatsapp - https://lnkd.in/dvk8prj5 Built for devs who want to crack interviews — not just solve problems.",
