From the moment we are born, we are surrounded by relationships‚Äîsome given to us by birth, others chosen by us through the course of living. Parents, siblings, friends, colleagues, and partners‚Äîall form threads in the web of our existence.

A relationship is not just being connected; it is being engaged, invested, and intertwined in a way that shapes both who we are and who we become. hashtag #rajeevelt hashtag #relationship",
