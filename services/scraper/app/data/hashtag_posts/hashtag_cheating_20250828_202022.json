      "text": "For an awareness drive to protect from fraud, I am sharing one recent interaction. For my daughter I posted one advertisement regarding online teacher. One lady ( INDRANI MUKHERJEE) approached me in Facebook messenger that she provides online tution. Even after certain months of bearing her with a hope that she can do better in helping my daughter but finally she cheated me by taking advance for tution and blocked all contacts to connect her. She informed that she was connected to Physics Wallah Vidyapeeth Coaching Center Durgapur , and hence I trusted her. Requesting all premier educational coaching centres to avoid recruiting teachers with integrity issues as it will seriously impact the real vision of education. It’s my fault to trust her , so it’s an awareness drive from my end to protect yourself from such frauds. hashtag #fraud hashtag #durgapur hashtag #cheating hashtag #awareness hashtag #onlinetution hashtag #PhysicsWallah",

      "text": "So a CEO gets caught cheating at a Coldplay concert, and the internet loses its mind. Of course. Because nothing excites us more than someone else’s downfall. But why is romantic cheating the only kind we are obsessed with? Cheating isn’t just about affairs...it’s a lifestyle choice! - You take credit for a coworker’s idea? Cheating. - You fake a smile while secretly hating someone? Cheating. - You use “connections” or better known in India as JUGAAD...to skip the line? Cheating. - You lie to yourself with “I will start tomorrow”? Cheating. - You borrow money and make the lender feel illegal for asking for their own money back? Cheating. We love pointing fingers at scandals but ignore the tiny betrayals we commit daily. Maybe fix that first. hashtag #cheating hashtag #choice hashtag #gossip",
