      "text": "A student at Early Steps Academy sent me this email 🥲🥲 I was hesitating to put this up here as I feared judgement on the kid’s language, But, I thought it’s worth putting out as what I see in that language is pure passion Hightened emotion about discovering love for the first time 🥹 A child just SO excited about learning! No push from parent, No fear of grades. Pure fun of learning ! Also loved the boldness to find and write to the founder directly. This part, probably comes from being American. 🇺🇸 An unshaken self-believe and hashtag #confidence to change the world. The best feedback for any product comes from the consumers, they say. And when our consumers show so much emotion, We know we are in the right direction 😁 hashtag #student hashtag #feedback hashtag #learning",

      "text": "Staying calm and confident under pressure is one of the toughest challenges in high-stakes moments—whether it’s pitching an idea, presenting to a large audience, or trying to learn something new under stress. These are the situations where the mind races, stress levels rise, and performance often dips. That’s what makes 🚀 WotNow?! – a Neuro-AI Coach for pitching, presenting, and learning – so fascinating. Instead of only preparing you beforehand, it actually coaches you in real-time as you’re speaking or studying: 🧠 Tracks your speech, focus, and stress signals on the spot 🎯 Gives adaptive feedback to keep you calm, confident, and sharp 💼 Works for individuals and teams, helping not just productivity but communication and performance as a whole ✨ Blends performance + learning + wellness into one seamless experience What really excites me → most AI tools are about doing tasks faster. But WotNow?! focuses on something deeper: empowering humans in high-stakes cognitive moments — from closing a deal to pitching investors, teaching, or preparing for exams. 👉👉 Download on the App Store https://lnkd.in/ghCwY99e 📌 Live on Product Hunt: https://lnkd.in/gsUv_hP3 I believe this is just the beginning of a bigger shift — where AI won’t just save us time, but actually make us better at the things only humans can do: thinking, speaking, learning, and connecting. hashtag #AI hashtag #NeuroAI hashtag #PublicSpeaking hashtag #Pitching hashtag #Learning hashtag #Productivity hashtag #PresentationSkills hashtag #EdTech hashtag #FutureOfWork hashtag #AItools hashtag #PerformanceCoaching hashtag #Teamwork",
