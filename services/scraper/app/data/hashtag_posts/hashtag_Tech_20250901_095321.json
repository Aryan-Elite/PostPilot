      "text": "🪄 Bringing Harry Potter's magic to life with AI! ✨ The completion of an invisibility cloak project, built using Python and computer vision, is announced. Replacing a specific color with a stored background creates a real-time, disappearing effect. This was a challenging and fun way to explore the power of hashtag #OpenCV and hashtag #ComputerVision. What started as a fun idea is now a working reality. Check out the demo video. hashtag #AiLearning hashtag #MachineLearning hashtag #Python hashtag #Deeplearning hashtag #Innovation hashtag #OpenSource The process involved: 1. Capturing a static background frame 📸 2.Detecting a specific cloth color in HSV color space 🎨 3.Applying image segmentation and morphological transformations to refine the mask. 4.Replacing the colored cloak area with the background to create the illusion. This was a fascinating exercise in background subtraction and color masking. Learned a ton about fine-tuning parameters to handle tricky lighting conditions. Future plans include exploring more advanced deep learning segmentation models for an even smoother effect. hashtag #ComputerVision hashtag #ImageProcessing hashtag #AI hashtag #Coding hashtag #ProjectUpdate hashtag #Tech",

The idea is simple yet magical: 🪄Capture the background →Detect cloak color (red) → Replace it with background You disappear! Learned a lot about: →Computer Vision (color detection, masking) →Image Processing with OpenCV →Real-time video manipulation Github:https: https://lnkd.in/gZmaryT5 (Is it same as using a green screen cloth? It's not exactly the same as a green screen. A green screen replaces the background, but here we're replacing a specific cloth color with the background, which creates the invisibility effect.)
