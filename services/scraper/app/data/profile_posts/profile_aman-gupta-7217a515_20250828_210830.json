      "text": "Entrepreneurs can also be celebrities as entrepreneurship is now being celebrated. Now, you can see me and other amazing Indian entrepreneurs on The Kapil Sharma Show. This is an extremely heartwarming moment for the 20 year old Aman. Kyoki India mein celebrity ka matlab hamesha sirf do cheezein raha hai : Cricket ya Bollywood Entrepreneurs ne kabhi socha bhi nahi tha ki logon ka itna pyaar milna possible hai 🙏 And start up stories and experiences can also be as cool as Sixers and Blockbusters. And I loved being there on the show. Pls do watch it. Streaming now on Netflix. ✌️",

      "text": "I love working with Gen Z and also the young millenials. 10 years ago when I was in corporate, boss ke cabin ke bahar khada hota tha toh haath kaampte the. Sawaal karne ki soch bhi nahi thi. Boss ne bola karna hai, toh karna hai. End of story. But today, in my office, 20 year old interns walk up and ask “AG, why are we doing this? Are you sure it’s right?” We used to say Yes boss. And they ask, Why boss? 0 filter, 0 fear, 0 guilt They don’t say “Hanji sir, ji sir” unless they actually mean it. And honestly I HATE it when people confuse that honesty with disrespect. Sure, may not have decades of experience, but they have got something we did not: Exposure. They know what we don’t. They have seen more, sooner, and faster than we ever did. They are global citizens and watching the world around, when we used to only watch Doordarshan while growing up. Humare time pe Mummy ke guests ke liye ek Pepsi ya chips ke liye 15 min bhaagna padta tha. Aaj sab kuch ek tap pe aa jaata hai thanks to Quick Commerce. 🤷🏻‍♂️ It changes how they think and we should respect that. At boAt Lifestyle, esp in our marketing team, we have a lot of under 30 and Gen Zs. And every time I talk to them, I realise that they don’t just work for money. They work because they care. They live freely. They create fearlessly. Some call it rebellion. Some say they are lazy. But I see courage. Courage to speak up and To question what does not make sense or To push back when things feel off or To actually give a damn. And maybe the question is not how to manage them. Maybe the real question is, how do we make sure we work with them and learn from them.",

      "text": "We grew up watching Roadies or Splitsvilla. They are growing up watching Shark Tank. So many students I meet today in schools and colleges want to become entrepreneurs. And not just want, they will. 🔥 The next wave of young, fiery founders is coming and they will be breaking the rules we were punished for, building what we could only dream of. And believe me, this is just the beginning. Thank you Google for naming me Visionary Entrepreneur of the year 2025 and trusting me to be a part of the 1 Million Founders mission and it feels nice to receive it in front of my all time supporter, my dad Neeraj Gupta. Was an absolute blast being on a panel on Viksit Bharat 2047 with some incredible energy and even better intent. Suniel Shetty, who has an unstoppable energy on and off the stage. Raj Shamani, my dear friend and full time firestarter and Shantanu Naidu, a man driven by purpose bigger than profits. And of course, Mehak Kasbekar, the moderator who made it all seamless, sharp, and super fun Grateful for conversations that care about purpose, people, and the power of building in India. 🇮🇳 More panels like this, please. 🔥 All of us will witness what’s coming next in India. And it is going to be wild. Let’s build. Let’s believe. LESSGOO! ✌🏻 boAt Lifestyle Brut India Google Priyanka Sharma",

      "text": "Grateful 🙏 I have never asked God for anything, yet He has given me more than I ever imagined. I have taken risks without overanalyzing. Bet on things that made 0 sense on paper. Walked into the unknown with nothing but faith. And every single time, something clicked. Something worked out. Not by chance, not by luck, but by something far greater than my own plans 🤗 I just kept moving, kept doing the right things, and He kept blessing me in ways I never expected. My loving family, incredible friends, boAt Lifestyle, Shark Tank India and the overwhelming love from all of you ❤️ I never asked for these gifts. I only believed that as long as I kept walking in the right direction humbly, everything would work out! So when you think no one is watching, He is. When you feel unseen, He sees it all Another year older, another year wiser. Protected, guided, and endlessly grateful 🙌😇🧿🙏",

      "text": "Honored to join Hon. PM Narendra Modi, President Emmanuel Macron, and global leaders at the CEO Forum with the backdrop of AI Action Summit representing boAt Lifestyle, Make in India, and our startup ecosystem on the global stage 🇮🇳🙏🏻 Here’s what I shared: 1. With over 100,000 startups, 100+ unicorns, and being the 3rd largest ecosystem globally, India is a powerhouse of innovation. It’s time to connect the dots globally France should send its best minds to Startup Mahakumbh (April, Delhi), and India must show up at Viva Tech (June, Paris). We need more Founder-led partnerships in the future and France should also leverage programmes like Invest in India. 2. From Importing to Exporting Tech: There was a time when we relied on global giants for tech. Now, we MAKE and EXPORT tech, from boAt headphones to Apple iPhones. Make in India is a reality. French companies can tap into this wave by partnering with Indian manufacturers, leveraging PLI/PMP schemes, and setting up joint facilities. 3. This forum goes beyond partnerships - it is a call for tech businesses worldwide to drive meaningful solutions for tomorrow. We are building, innovating, and creating new possibilities for AI, Smart Manufacturing and tech. And if there is one thing I realized, it is this: The world is watching India. But more importantly, the world wants to work with India Jai Hind. The future is here, and it’s MADE IN INDIA 🔥 Namaste and Merci beaucoup 🇮🇳🤝🇫🇷",

      "text": "First Monday after budget looked like a Diwali in office🔥Everyone was so happy as if they got a raise or a promotion 😆💰 I saw many folks lined up in front of Finance’s cabin: \"Kitna zyada milega abse?\" “What’s the new in hand salary we’ll get?” The 2025 budget shifted the mood of the country. For Employees, it means more money in hand. For Brands, it means higher demand. For Startups, there is tax holiday extension. For Investors, there is 10k Fund of funds For Make In India, there is a new mission and intent both from the Government. For Corproates, there is no additional tax. It’s one of those rare moments where sab jeet gaye! ✌️ And honestly, I have not met a single person who’s upset about this Budget! This is more than just tax relief, it’s about confidence in a stronger, more self reliant India. An India where growth is not limited to just big corporates or big sharks , but reaches every street, every home, and every aspiring dreamer. So, here we are, thanking you for that extra money and much needed moral boost. 🇮🇳🇮🇳",
