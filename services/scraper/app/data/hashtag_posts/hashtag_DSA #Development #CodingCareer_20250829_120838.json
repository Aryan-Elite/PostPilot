It took days of consistent effort (with the help of W3Schools.com and other resources) to build these notes. My goal is to make learning DSA simpler, structured, and more engaging — both for myself and others who want a strong foundation. This is just one step in my AI/ML learning journey, and I’m excited to keep sharing my progress. 🚀 credit: Mirza Yasir Abdullah Baig hashtag #DSA hashtag #DataStructures hashtag #Algorithms hashtag #Coding hashtag #Programming hashtag #Python hashtag #LearnDSA hashtag #HandwrittenNotes hashtag #w3schools hashtag #LinkedIn hashtag #connections hashtag #LinkedinCommunity hashtag #LinkedInLearning hashtag #viral hashtag #fyp hashtag #notes hashtag #AI hashtag #ML hashtag #machinelearning hashtag #softwareengineering hashtag #artificialintelligence",

You fail because you're preparing the wrong way❌ Most candidates waste time solving random problems⌛ But what if you had a structured roadmap that top candidates use to crack SDE roles? I’m sharing handwritten notes of the Striver's SDE Sheet—a complete, step-by-step guide covering all essential DSA topics, so you focus on what actually matters. No more guesswork. No more wasted effort. If you're preparing for DSA interviews, this is the preparation strategy you need. Repost to help others.
