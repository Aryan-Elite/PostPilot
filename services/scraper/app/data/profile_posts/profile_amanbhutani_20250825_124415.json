      "text": "A few weeks ago two freshmen at UW, Prabhgun Basi and Akalsukh Basi, shared with me that it was hard to find a productive project for the summer. Turns out this is true for a lot of students. The GoDaddy People Ops team has done a fantastic job creating a 'summer camp' focused on aspiring high schoolers, freshmen and sophomores at college where they get to experience the 'Future of Work' using AI in every part of their role. I am super excited about this and plan to run one of the tracks as part of this. We are all excited to create a productive summer for lots of young students - https://lnkd.in/gVN-pmst",
