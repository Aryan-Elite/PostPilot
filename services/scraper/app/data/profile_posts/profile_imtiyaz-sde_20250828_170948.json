      "text": "Moved to Hyderabad (Must Read) ⬇ For the past couple of years, I’ve been working as a freelancer, building websites, apps, and AI/ML projects for clients across various domains. I still remember my first project - a simple blood donation website for a small blood bank. Since then, I haven’t stopped building. 💼 How I found clients: 🔹 Personal and professional connections 🔹 The open-source community 🔹 Freelancing platforms 🔹 Cold emailing { This journey taught me a lot. } 📝 Freelancing and open-source work helped me: 🔹 Sharpen my development skills 🔹 Work with people from diverse backgrounds 🔹 Deliver projects with full independence and ownership Now, as I’ve moved to Hyderabad, my goals are to: 🔹 Attend tech events and business meetups 🔹 Connect with like-minded professionals 🔹 Find a full-time role as a Software Developer (Remote or On-site) If you know about upcoming events, hackathons, or SDE openings in Hyderabad, I’d be grateful for your recommendations or introductions. 🌐 Portfolio: imtiyaz-dev.vercel.app 📩 Email: syedimtiyazali141@gmail.com hashtag #Hyderabad hashtag #TechEvents hashtag #Hackathons hashtag #SDE hashtag #AI hashtag #Networking hashtag #Opportunities",
