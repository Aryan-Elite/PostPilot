But we often forget — the founder themselves is the biggest campaign. Think about it: When you picture Tesla, you don’t just think of cars. You think of Elon Musk. When you think of Zomato, you don’t just think of food delivery. You think of Deepinder’s bold tweets...and even delivering food himself. Why? Because products build trust. But people (the founders) build recall. Today the strongest brand strategy isn’t just paid ads, billboards. It’s the founder showing up online — sharing their vision, failures, learnings. That’s how strangers become followers, Followers become customers, And customers become loyal fans. hashtag #FounderBranding hashtag #SMBGrowth hashtag #BuildingInPublic",

Good job Goibibo - if your campaign makes people turn upside down (literally), you’ve nailed memorability.",

      "text": "The Hidden Thief Called Inflation 10 years ago, my mom used to buy a full bag of groceries for ₹1,000. Today, the same bag costs ₹2,000+. That’s inflation. It doesn’t steal your money directly. It slowly reduces what your money can buy. Let’s put this in perspective: ₹100 in 2005 bought 5 liters of petrol. ₹100 today barely buys 1 liter. So when we keep our money idle in a savings account at 3–4%, and inflation is running at 6–7%, we are actually losing money in real terms. 👉 This is why investing is not a luxury, it’s a necessity. Equity, mutual funds, and other growth assets don’t just grow your money — they protect it from inflation eating away its value. For example: ₹10,000 in a fixed deposit at 5% return for 10 years becomes ~₹16,000. But if inflation is 6%, your real value is only ~₹9,000. You thought you earned, but you actually lost. 💡 Inflation is silent, but powerful. The only defense is to make your money grow faster than prices.",

      "text": "₹400 CRORE… . . . . Yes, you heard that right. ✈️ IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd) saves ₹400 Cr every year with just 2 smart decisions. Not by selling more tickets. Not by flying more routes. But by turning flights around faster and cutting excess weight. Here’s how 👇 1. 10-Minute Turnaround → 200 Extra Flights/Year IndiGo’s secret weapon? Speed. They consistently land 10–15 minutes early. Their crew deboard passengers faster. This allows them to fit in 200 extra flights per year - all with the same fleet. ✅ More time saved = more revenue, without extra cost. 2. No Ovens = 60 Kg Lighter Flights They removed ovens from planes. Why? Each oven weighs 20 kg. Multiply that by 3 per flight = 60 kg saved. This small change leads to ₹2000–₹3000 fuel savings per flight, which adds up to ₹400 Cr annually across all routes. ✅ Less weight = less fuel ✅ Less fuel = more savings 💡 The lesson? You don’t always need to add more. You need to remove smarter. So ask yourself today - ✅ What’s your 10-minute hack? ✅ What’s that you can eliminate? ✅ How much could you gain by doing less? Because in business (and life), Small optimizations create massive outcomes.",

      "text": "One scan and boom — financial regrets unlocked. I was about to order the same product I already had — just because of a SALE. That’s when it hit me… When I used cash, I used to think twice before spending. Standing at a shop, I’d literally count the notes and whisper to myself: “Do I really need this?” 🤔 Sometimes even walk away dramatically like it’s a Karan Johar climax. Then came UPI. One scan and swoosh — money gone faster than my Monday motivation. It’s like my bank account is directly connected to Kuber Devta himself. The funny thing? Technology gave me convenience. But it also made me too comfortable spending. Ease of spending isn’t the problem — lack of awareness is. Track it, budget it, own it.
