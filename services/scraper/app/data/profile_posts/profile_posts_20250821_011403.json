    "text": "Just spent my lunch break helping a three-eyed cat escape Microsoft Office tools.\n\nNo, I’m not losing it. This is‘s new browser game “Escape the Office” and it’s oddly therapeutic.\n\nThe Concept:\nYou play as Mr. Peepers (the cat) literally running away from corporate meetings, PowerPoint presentations, and Excel spreadsheets to reach vacation paradise.\n\nHaving spent 3 years at Microsoft, dodging endless status meetings and fighting with PowerPoint formatting, this game feels like my actual experience.\n\nEvery obstacle you dodge represents the tools that slow us down:\n• Legacy PowerPoint templates\n• Endless formatting struggles• Death by a thousand status updates\n• Meetings that could’ve been emails\n\nThe faster you collect Gamma power-ups in the game, the quicker you escape to vacation mode. Just like real life - Gamma helps me finish presentations in minutes instead of hours.\n\nStarted in a gray corporate cubicle (triggering Microsoft flashbacks), collected Gamma boosts, and watched the world transform into a sunny beach paradise.\n\nThe best part? Collect 5 in-game hats and Gamma ships you a real “Out of Office” hat. I’m definitely going for it.\n\nThis isn’t about hating work. It’s about working smarter so you can actually log off and enjoy life.\n\nSince using Gamma, I’ve gone from spending entire weekends on presentations to finishing them during coffee breaks.\n\nLess time in Office tools = More time out of office.\n\nTry escaping here:\n\nWhat’s your dream “out of office” destination? 👇",
