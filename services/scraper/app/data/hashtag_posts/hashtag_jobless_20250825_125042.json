      "text": "Good day to all of you. If you‚Äôre listening to this right now, and you‚Äôve lost your job‚Ä¶ if your phone has stopped ringing, if the people you helped aren't helping you back, if you feel invisible ‚Äî I want you to hear me clearly: You are not broken. You are being rebuilt. This world often teaches us to measure our worth by our titles, salaries, or how many people stand by us when things are good. But real strength? It‚Äôs found in the silence. In the struggle. In the lonely nights where you still decide to try again the next morning. You may have lost a job, but you haven't lost your skills, your experience, or your value. The rejection wasn‚Äôt the end ‚Äî it was redirection. And yes, people may not have shown up for you when you needed them. But take that pain, and use it as fuel. Because when you rise, you‚Äôll rise without owing anyone. No one helped you? Good. Now when you make it, and you will, it‚Äôll be 100% yours. Your resilience. Your grit. Your comeback. So update that resume. Apply for that job. Start that side hustle. Move forward quietly ‚Äî but powerfully. Because you‚Äôre not done. You‚Äôre not over. You are just getting started. hashtag #share hashtag #follow hashtag #like hashtag #gudfrid hashtag #gudfrid4u hashtag #pharmajobs hashtag #engineeringjobs hashtag #Pharmaceutical hashtag #jobopenings hashtag #pharmajobs # hashtag #pharmaopenings hashtag #freshers hashtag #experience hashtag #jobless hashtag #bestrong, hashtag #selfmotivation",
