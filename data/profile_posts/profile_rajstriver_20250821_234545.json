It’s about:\n\n- Making sure people are happy\n- Making sure everyone feels heard\n- Helping people grow in their careers\n- Making sure the team works well together\n\nSome days it feels like a big responsibility, but that’s what it is, taking care of people, not just tasks.\n\nStill learning every day, but one thing is clear: when the team feels good, the work automatically gets better. 🙌\n\nWe are building:",

A user prepared on our platform for 2 months, got what he needed, and once done… went searching for any reason to get a refund, since he couldn’t find any significant flaw in the platform’s effectiveness.\n\nOur product page clearly states:\n\n- C++, Java, Python, JS, C#, and Go.\n- No mention of any other language. No promise that we’d ever add them.\n\nYet the refund demand was because we didn’t have his preferred language.\n\nIt’s like eating at a restaurant, finishing your meal, and then asking for your money back because they didn’t serve sushi, even though it’s not on the menu.\n\nLoved the “consumer court” threat for something never listed nor promised.\n\nWhat’s next? Regional language coding support?\n\nTough to run a consumer-facing product 😄",

Also this is a part of the plan where we go global!\n\nAlso, we are making sure we go slow and follow all the good coding practices we had skipped while building the MVP due to time constraints, as we want to scale and build a few more products in the future, something that may not be possible with the current codebase if we don’t refactor now.",
