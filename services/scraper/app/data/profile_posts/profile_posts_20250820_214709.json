    "text": "Just last week, I spent 2 hours trying to understand a complex PR from my teammate - commit history, jumping between files, and still feeling lost about the logic flow.\n\nThis is exactly why I'm excited about getting early access toChat.\n\nInstead of context-switching between my IDE, GitHub, and Slack to understand code changes, I can now just ask Graphite directly. It has the full context of my codebase history and can even search the web when needed.\n\nSome things that this Graphite AI Chat offers:\n- Instant code explanations - It highlights any lines and gets step-by-step breakdowns.\n- Proactive risk detection - This flags performance issues and logic bugs before review.\n- Direct PR fixes - It applies suggested changes automatically to your branch.\n- CI failure diagnosis - This feature understands your CI context and suggests fixes.\n- Comment resolution - It helps address feedback from both AI and human reviewers.\n\nWhat I love most is how it removes the friction from code review.\n\nGraphite is now a complete code review platform, and honestly, this feels like the missing piece that makes the whole experience seamless.\n\nDevelopers building solo or in teams - this is worth checking out. I also created a short demo below, checkout here:",
