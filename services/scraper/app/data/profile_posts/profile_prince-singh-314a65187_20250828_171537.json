      "text": "For DSA, we often see the same type of post everywhere \"You don‚Äôt need to solve 1000+ problems, just solve 250 questions.\" Freshers usually start with this mindset, but after some time they come back and say \"Kuch bhi nahi Hua\" (Nothing changed) ‚Äî they don‚Äôt feel much more confident. Why does this happen? Yes, 250 problems are enough but what does ‚Äú250 problems‚Äù really mean? Those 250‚Äì300 problems should cover all the classical problems and patterns across major topics. But solving them doesn‚Äôt automatically make you a problem solver. üëâ DSA learning and problem-solving are two different things. - Solving 250‚Äì300 problems helps you build a mental map of problem patterns. - But true problem-solving ability depends on consistent practice. - Implementation and confidence come only when you solve problems daily and challenge your mind regularly. As Bruce Lee said \"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.\" The right mindset is very important before starting anything.",
