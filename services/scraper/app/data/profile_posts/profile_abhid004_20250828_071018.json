      "text": "3 Years in and I still have stand-up anxiety. I'm horrified updating the team that ‚Ä¢ It's not finished. ‚Ä¢ You're still working on it. ‚Ä¢ You're struggling. When everyone else got their tasks done. I feel guilty not saying the same. When it feels like everyone is judging you for not getting it done or not delivering on your promises I force myself to find good news to share. I might have a PR out today... or maybe not. I'm close to figuring it out... but I'll need to ask for help. It's just about done... which can be 1-3 business days depending on weather conditions. Everyday I'm more worried about how I'm presenting myself to the team instead of sharing real updates. I feel anxious, worried, and overwhelmed. All from a 15 minute meeting in the morning. Honestly, I never got over it working at Amazon, or Microsoft. It got better joining a team at Google that has stand-ups once a week. But when I asked my senior engineer about having stand up anxiety He tells me: \"Glad I'm not the only one\" hashtag #alexcancode hashtag #anxiety hashtag #softwarengineer",
